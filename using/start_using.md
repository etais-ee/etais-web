ETAIS is intended for research communities in Estonia as well as R&D companies. To get access to the resources,
an usage agreement must be made signed ETAIS and an organization requesting to join.

Once an organization account has been created, provisioning and access to its resources is configured through
the self-service portal. To access it you need an account from [TaaT](http://taat.edu.ee/) or
[eduGAIN](https://www.geant.org/Services/Trust_identity_and_security/eduGAIN).
