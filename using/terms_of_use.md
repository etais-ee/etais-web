## Terms of Use of the ETAIS self-service portal

ETAIS reserves the right to change, add or remove portions of these Terms of Use, at any time. It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Use periodically for changes. The most recent version of the Terms of Use is posted on this website and you are deemed to have accepted the Terms of Use on your first use of the ETAIS infrastructure following the alterations.

**1. Who can use ETAIS infrastructure?**

The main purpose of the ETAIS’s infrastructure is to serve Estonian students and researchers.
We also provide services for public institutions and private organizations. Services can be ordered by persons with the right to represent the institution or organization.

**2. How to use ETAIS infrastructure?**

To gain access to ETAIS infrastructure you have to register yourself by creating an account in the ETAIS portal. For that you must identify yourself with the TAAT (Estonian academic authentication and authorization infrastructure), eduGAIN (education global authentication infrastructure) or TARA (Estonian national authentication service) authentication system.
In the case of a public institution or private organization when the right of representation does not come from the Estonian business register, please contact us at etais@etais.ee

**3. When can I start using ETAIS infrastructure?**

Access to the resources is granted through the queue system to balance the load and access between different users.
In order to get your job in the queue, it has to be created and queued by the rules specified in the [user guides](https://docs.hpc.ut.ee/public/ETAIS/overview/).
User groups might also be assigned a priority mark which can also change the order of the queue.

**4. Service providers’ rights and responsibilities**

- Service providers can restrict access of users who have violated the Terms of Use.
- Service providers provide users with user guides (published on the website) and additional guidance (by email, phone, in-person) when needed.
- Service providers give their best to help users with user’s specific software, but cannot give any guarantees.
- Service providers are not held responsible for any data loss, leakage or damage caused by force majeure, the user activity or inactivity or a third party whose access has become possible due to (in)activity of the user.
- Service providers reserve the right to remove any data at any time and/or transfer data to other individuals (working on the same or similar project) after a user account is deleted or closed.
In some cases, service providers may elect to make backup copies of some data files. When backup copies are made, service providers reserve the right to hold such backup copies indefinitely or to delete them.

**5. Users’ rights and responsibilities**

- Users must follow the Terms of Use, read and accept Privacy Policy and follow all legal acts of Estonia and EU without exception when using ETAIS resources.
