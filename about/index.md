**ETAIS - Estonian Scientific Computing Infrastructure**

Estonian Scientific Computing Infrastructure (ETAIS) belongs to the Estonian roadmap of research infrastructures
providing computing and storage resources for Estonian scientific community. ETAIS project is being carried out by a
consortium of four institutions: University of Tartu, Tallinn University of Technology, National Institute of
Chemical Physics and Biophysics and Information Technology Foundation for Education.

ETAIS aims to increase the competitiveness of the Estonian computing and data-intensive research disciplines by
providing access to a new and modern scientific computing infrastructure. The immediate aim of the core infrastructure
is to manage the the joint scientific computing infrastructure established for Estonian R&D, which allows Estonian
researchers to successfully operate in computing and data-intensive research disciplines.

The infrastructure includes hardware (computers, storage media, network devices), the server rooms, software and
support services necessary for the operation of the helpdesk. ETAIS infrastructure is in compliance with international
cloud and high performance computing infrastructures and follows the best practices of the field.
