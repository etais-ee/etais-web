**Goals of ETAIS project**

New ETAIS project "ETAIS 2" started in the beginning of 2017 and its main goal is to integrate the infrastructures created during the previous ETAIS project. A brand new component of ETAIS project will be a self-service portal that allows users to access the resources regardless of their location or operating system used. Computing and data storage (including mid-term archiving) capabilities as well as the customer support will be significally improved.

The ETAIS infrastructure will continue to be divided between the four institutions – the project aims to optimise resources and share costs (staff, electricity) between partners. It is also important that the project’s partners create a shared knowledge base and therefore improve the quality of the ETAIS services.

The project consists of the following sub-projects:

- Setting up cloud service  
- Setting up a self-service portal  
- Renewal of the authentication platform [TAAT (TAAT2)](http://taat.edu.ee/main/about/?lang=en "TAAT info")  
- Increasing computing and data storing capability (additional hardware)  
- Implementing information security system  [ISKE](https://www.ria.ee/en/iske-en.html "RIA ISKE page")
