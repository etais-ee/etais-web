**Computing servers**

    0.012 euros per CPU core hour or
    0.012 euros per 6 GB of memory/hour.
    0.5 euros per GPU hour.

    Memory usage is calculated by 6 GB segments.
    (price depends on the use of which resource is greater). 
  
 For example, in case of a virtual server m.xsmall flavor with 1 processor core, 1GB of ram and 10GB of SSD storage space allocated for it, will cost 1*0.003*24*365 = 26 euros per year for the CPU and 1*0.0013*24*365 = 11 euros per year for RAM and 1/10*0.138*24*365 = 120 euros per year for the storage space

**Storage space**

    80 euros per 1 TB per year
    In case of 2x replicated data, 160 euros per 1 TB per year.
    A copy stored on tape costs 30 euros per 1 TB per year.
