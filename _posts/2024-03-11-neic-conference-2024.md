The NeIC 2024 conference in Tallinn on May 27-29 brings together e-infrastructure experts, researchers, policymakers, and e-infrastructure providers from the Nordics and beyond.

[NeIC](https://neic.no/) facilitates the development and operation of high-quality e-infrastructure solutions in areas of joint Nordic-Baltic interest. NeIC is a distributed organization consisting of technical experts from academic institutions across the Nordic countries and Estonia. The NeIC conferences are organized biannually, and in 2024, the conference theme is “Nordic e-Infrastructure Tomorrow”.

The conference takes place at the Park Inn by Radisson Meriton Conference & Spa Hotel (Paldiski 4, Tallinn). The programme includes lightning talks, science sessions, workshops, and an entertaining social dinner. This year, the conference is combined with the NeIC all-hands meeting, an annual internal event for everyone working on NeIC's projects. If you are NeIC personnel or board member, we invite you to join us for the entire three-day event combining the AHM and the conference.

Call for papers and [registration for the conference](https://indico.neic.no/event/259/overview) is now open. Register by 28.04.2024. The early bird deadline is March 15th.
