title: "FFPlus project funds European SMEs and start-ups wanting to use supercomputers"
---

FFplus is a European initiative highlighting and promoting the adoption of high-performance computing (HPC) by SMEs and start-ups across Europe. The strategic objective of using HPC and supercomputers is to support and empower European SMEs and start-ups towards innovation. The Digital Europe Programme funds the project, with a total budget of EUR 30 million. Estonian SMEs and start-ups have a unique opportunity to participate in this process.

The computational methods encompass extensive possibilities: modelling and simulation, data analytics, machine learning, and AI â€“ all options empowering SMEs through enhanced innovation and competitiveness.

The benefits of using HPC include:

* saving time for product/service development and decreasing time to market;
* saving costs by optimising data processing tasks;
* increased efficiency and higher levels of innovation;
* more specialised, tailor-made products and services;
* greater competitiveness;
* gaining new knowledge and know-how from R&D experts.

During the project's lifetime (2024-2028), SMEs and start-ups will be supported through six open calls to fund business experiments and innovation studies.

**Business experiments** will address the uptake of HPC by SMEs to solve specific business challenges of SMEs that have yet to have prior use of, or experience with, HPC services.

**Innovation studies**, in contrast, will support European SMEs and start-ups already active in generative AI technology, which need more computational resources to scale up.

Successful applicants will receive funding and support from FFplus to conduct these sub-projects. As computing resources, Estonian SMEs and start-ups can use the Estonian national e-infrastructure or LUMI, the fastest supercomputer in Europe.

The First Open Call will remain open for submissions until **September 4th, 2024**, at 17:00 Brussels local time.
