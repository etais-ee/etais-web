title: 4th Baltic HPC and Cloud Conference in Riga on April 11-12, 2024"
---

We invite you to join the conference for the Baltic Sea region to exchange ideas and discuss future collaboration models with NCCs, CoEs, EDIHs, and governmental representatives. We will have separate sessions dedicated to each of these topics, including Industry sessions with real-life examples from SMEs in using HPC, Quantum Computing with European perspective and main differences between QC and HPC. We will look into new developments in HPC and HPC training, as well as authentication possibilities to access HPC. This is an event for the Baltic countries to learn from the experience of the Nordic countries.
The conference will be especially relevant for different research communities that use HPC, including students, HPC experts, and industry.

The conference is organised by National HPC Competence Centres (NCCs) in Latvia (SuperS), Estonia, Lithuania, Sweden (ENCCS), Finland (CSC), and Denmark (DK-NCC) within the framework of the EuroCC 2 project.
Conference programme is available [here](https://hpc.rtu.lv/4th-baltic-hpc-and-cloud-conference/?lang=en). 
Participation is free of charge. Registration is now open.
