title: "The EuroCC project has been successfully completed"
---

The 2-year EuroCC project, funded by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and 33 participating European states, has come to a successful end.
The main aim of the EuroCC was to build a sustainable and globally competitive European HPC ecosystem. To achieve this goal, each of the 33 member states have established National Competence Centres (NCCs). At the same time, Coordination and Support Action CASTIEL has coordinated activities like international workshops, mentoring and twinning partnerships, and topic-specific working groups to address issues of shared interest. The two projects have bridged the existing HPC skills gaps while promoting cooperation and the implementation of best practices across Europe.
NCC Estonia was established on 1st of September 2020 on the basis of the ETAIS consortium. The mission of NCC has been to analyze, implement and coordinate all necessary activities and offer services to Estonian end users to cover their needs: from access to resources, from technological consultancy to the provision of training courses for academia, public administrations and industry.
