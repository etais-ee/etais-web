title: "Data Science Seminar: Driving Innovation with High-Performance Computing"
---

**The UT Institute of Computer Science and the UT High-Performance Computing Centre invite all those interested to discover the exciting world of supercomputers, high-performance computing, and their possible uses.**

High-performance computing allows researchers to solve the most complex challenges quickly and even explore areas where experiments are unthinkable. Successful companies apply supercomputers for innovative R&D activities, cost reduction, and competitive advantage.

At the seminar, we will hear inspiring presentations about how experts in various fields use supercomputers and what benefits they can get from it.

**See you on November 26 at the Delta study building of the University of Tartu! The seminar will begin at 16.15, welcome coffee at 15:45.**
